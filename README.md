Download LibreTranslate on Windows

Installing LibreTranslate on windows was NOT easy, which is why I am making this tutorial. For this to work, you need to be running python 3.10.

first, you have to navigate to the whls folder attached and run:

pip install PyICU-2.7.4-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

wait for it to finish

then, run: 

pycld2-0.41-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

wait for it to finish.
